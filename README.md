BROADSWORD - A WordPress Theme

Broadsword began as a project between myself as developer and the very talented Michael Wong (@mizko on Twitter) as designer. This was our first WordPress theme intended for submission on ThemeForest, and after some initial feedback from the review team it was accepted and listed.

Sales were decent, but as with most themes on TF the curve drops off fairly quickly.  With no sales at all in the past six months we took down the page and I've decided to share the code here on GitHub.

The code was written in 2015 and looking back there are certainly things I would do differently, but all in all I'm happy with how it turned out. The clients that did purchase the theme gave us glowing reviews, which is a reward in and of itself.

You can actually read about our first few hours on TF in an article that got written up on WPTavern, based on a conversation I'd started on Reddit. Check out the article here: https://wptavern.com/new-theme-development-company-makes-first-sale-minutes-after-being-approved-on-themeforest
